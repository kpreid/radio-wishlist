# Kevin Reid's Radio Software Wishlist

[The issue tracker of this repository](https://github.com/kpreid/radio-wishlist/issues) is a list of problems and desirable features I see, with GNU Radio and related software, which I wish other people would work on.

* I justify bothering to publish such wishes on the grounds that the majority of them are of benefit to everyone, not just my own work.

* I publish them here instead of on individual projects' issue trackers when they are either too vague to be a good feature request, or when the project does not have an issue tracker of its own in use (`gr-osmosdr` in particular).
